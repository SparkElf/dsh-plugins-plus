/**
 * The one official slot this plugin shadows, declared structurally.

 * `settings.launcher` belongs to `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-settings`, which this

 * official UI version and make a profile that ships another fail to activate. The
 * declaration below mirrors `SettingsLauncherOwnerProps` from
 * `dsh-client-ui-settings/lib/types/client/contract/slots.d.ts` for the parts this
 * plugin uses; declaration merging adds members, so a deployment that loads the
 * official declaration still resolves the real, fully typed one.
