 * The `@`-mention picker: choose which conversation a knowledge file goes into.

 * broken. But "no conversation open" is exactly the state this page is in most of the
 * time: it is a management surface, not a chat. The reference still has to land
 * somewhere, so the click now asks where.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately borrowed rather than invented:
 *
 * The insertion itself is `referenceInChat`, the same contract the sidebar explorer
 * and the viewer's selection popup call. That function owns the whole policy this
 * dialog must not re-derive: which workspace root the mention is relative to, the
 * chip spelling for files versus folders, the quoted form for paths with spaces, and
 * the "degrade to a logged no-op" behaviour when a service is missing. Building a
 * second insertion path here would be the one way to make the two surfaces disagree.
 *
 * The session list and the navigation are the host's own services, resolved lazily
 * through `ctx.get` rather than injected: this dialog is mounted whether or not the
 * user has ever opened a conversation, and a page that cannot see `uiSession` must
 * still render (it would show an empty list, not crash).
