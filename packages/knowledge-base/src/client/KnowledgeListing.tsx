/**
 * A directory listing with the modification time each entry carries.
 *
 * The row is the file explorer's own row from `dsh-better-sidebar`, copied from
 * `src/client/FileTree.tsx` (`FileRow`/`DirRow`) and `src/client/sidebar.module.css`
 * (`.explorerRow`): the same `div[role=button]`, the same 14px glyph, the same
 * ellipsised name, the same trailing modified time that yields its right edge to
 * the same hover-revealed `@` reference button, and the same `depth * 22 + 6`
 * indent. A reader sees that tree in this window's right sidebar, so a second
 * design beside it reads as bolted on -- which is why this is a copy rather than
 * a re-drawing.
 *
 * What the borrowed tree cannot carry is why this list exists. Its host entry
 * shape (`FsEntry`: name, path, isDir, hidden, isSymlink, broken) has no
 * timestamp, so a row built from it can never show when a document last changed;
 * and its rows decide visibility from a shared curated store rather than from
 * per-user grants. This panel reads the same directories through the plugin's own
 * route, which stats each child, and its row carries a right-click into the grant
 * form the tree has no place for.
