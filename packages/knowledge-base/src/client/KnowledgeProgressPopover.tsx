/**
 * The progress notification button and its panel.
 *
 * Uploading a document and extracting its text are two waits a reader cannot see
 * otherwise: a dropped file looks like nothing happened until the bytes land, and a
 * scanned PDF looks uploaded while its `.md` sibling is still being produced.
 *
 * This is the notification form of that information: a bell in the panel header whose
 * badge counts the work still in flight, opening a panel that names every task. It
 * replaces an earlier strip pinned to the panel's foot, which was too narrow -- file
 * names were cut to a few characters ("中电信桂【2025】150号…"), which is exactly the
 * detail a reader needs to tell two uploads apart.
 *
 * Only the PRESENTATION lives here. The upload rows come from the panel's own upload
 * code and the extraction rows from `extract.status`; this module reads and retries,
 * it does not own either data path.
 *
 * @module @sparkelf/dsh-knowledge-base/client
