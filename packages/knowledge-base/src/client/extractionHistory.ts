/**
 * Failures this browser session saw that the Host has no task for.
 *
 * A refused extraction never reaches `extract.status`: the Host answers 404 before it
 * creates a queue entry, so the progress panel -- which reads only the Host's snapshot --
 * could not show the one failure the reader just hit. This store is the panel's own
 * memory of those refusals.
 *
 * It lives at module scope rather than in component state for one reason: the knowledge
 * panel unmounts when the reader visits another destination, and a failure that vanished
 * on navigation would be indistinguishable from one the feature never recorded. The
 * store is per page load, which is the "this session" the reader means -- a reload is a
 * new session, and the filesystem (not this array) remains the authority on disk.
