/**
 * The Home surface: the page's landing view.

 * Three ways to start, over a tabbed list of what the reader already has. The tabs
 * select the SET, and the table shows that set's rows; nothing here invents data,
 * so a tab with no rows says so rather than filling the table with placeholders.
 *
 * The listing comes from the same route the tree uses. Categorising a document as
 * "owned by me" or "shared with me" would need an owner per file, and the
 * knowledge tree carries none: it is a directory of documents whose authorization
 * lives in DataOps grants. So the tabs narrow by what the tree can actually
 * answer, and the Owner column is drawn from the grant data only when a caller
 * supplies it. Filling that column with a guess would be worse than leaving it
 * blank.
