/**
 * The row context menu for the knowledge tree.
 *
 * A right-click on a row used to jump straight to the permission surface, which meant a
 * reader looking for "save this file" got an operator's dialog instead. The menu is the
 * affordance a file list is expected to have, and it is built on the product's own `Menu`
 * primitive rather than a hand-rolled popover: keyboard walking, Escape, outside click,
 * and post-selection focus return are the primitive's behaviour, and a local copy of that
 * would drift.
 *
 * The menu is positioned from the pointer rather than from an anchor element, which is
 * what the primitive's `getAnchorRect` hook is for: a context menu opens where the reader
 * clicked, not below the row's own control.
 *
 * Every action here is a call to a route that already exists. Sharing is `grant`, the
 * star is `favorites.set`, and paste dispatches on what the clipboard holds: a cut pastes
 * through `move`, a copy through `copy`. Both resolve the destination from the entry's own
 * name, so a paste cannot rename; both carry a directory's whole subtree. The clipboard is
 * a client-side pair of paths and a flag -- nothing about a pending paste is worth a
 * server-side record, and a clipboard that survived a reload would be a paste the reader
 * could no longer see they had armed.
