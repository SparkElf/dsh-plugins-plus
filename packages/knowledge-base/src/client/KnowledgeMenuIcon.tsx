 *
 * The glyph is the product's own icon component rather than a local path: the rail
 * sits directly beside the other panel icons, and a hand-drawn stroke read visibly
 * heavier than its neighbours. Using the product icon keeps the rail uniform and
 * lets the size the sidebar passes through unchanged.
