/**
 * The knowledge tree, drawn by the product's own file explorer.
 *
 * The listing next door is a hand-built copy of `dsh-better-sidebar`'s explorer: its CSS
 * module says so ("Copied from the file explorer in dsh-better-sidebar", with each metric
 * measured against `.explorerRow`). A copy drifts -- the explorer gains sort controls,
 * inline rename, an upload strip, git tones, an open-with submenu, none of which arrive
 * in a copy -- so this component renders the REAL explorer instead, pointed at the
 * knowledge root.
 *
 * That is possible because `/workspace/kb` is a symlink into the caller's view: the
 * explorer's `cwd` is a plain absolute path, so pointing it there reads the knowledge tree
 * through exactly the machinery that reads any other workspace directory. Measured before
 * writing this: `POST /sidebar/api/fs.trees {cwd:'/workspace/kb'}` answers the tree's
 * entries, so no new route and no second file API are involved.
 *
 * What the explorer does NOT know about is the knowledge base's own metadata files
 * (`.kb-audit.jsonl`, `.kb-settings.json`, `.kb-tree-state.json`, `.pinned.json`,
 * `.view-mode.json`, `.kb-favorites.json`, `.kb-trash.json`). They live in the view so
 * every user's copy carries them, and they are neither knowledge documents nor anything
 * a reader should rename. They are filtered with the `exclude` prop, which the host
 * applies to the listing -- so they never arrive rather than being hidden after the fact.
 *
 * ## This bundle INLINES the explorer's source, which is why sort needs a sync step
 *
 * `FileTree` is imported as SOURCE (`dsh-better-sidebar/src/client/FileTree.tsx`), not as
 * the package's built output, so its code is compiled into this plugin's bundle. Sorting
 * lives in two places that this file depends on:
 *
 * - `file-tree-sort.ts` — the sort keys and comparators (a separate module, imported by
 *   `FileTree.tsx`);
 * - `listing-filter.ts` — the name-matching rule set, shared by the explorer and this
 *   plugin's list view. It lives in the explorer package, not here, precisely so the two
 *   surfaces cannot drift apart: `KnowledgeListing` imports it from there too, and there
 *   is only ONE implementation of "substring, case-insensitive, keep the parent chain".
 *   It also has to be synced, or the tree's `nameFilter` prop arrives with nothing to run;
 * - `fs-tree.ts` — the HOST side that puts `mtimeMs`/`size` on each row;
 * - `sidebar.module.css` / `locales.ts` — the visible row for "no file matched" and its
 *   two strings.
 *
 * That means a change to those files reaches this bundle by COPYING THE SOURCE into the
 * resolved package under `node_modules/.pnpm/@sparkelf+dsh-better-sidebar@.../` and
 * rebuilding here. It does NOT arrive by reinstalling the dependency from npm, and the
 * copy is LOST on a fresh `install` — at which point `sort` silently falls back to the
 * published keys (no `mtime`, no `size`) and the menu's choices stop matching the data.
 *
 * The durable source of truth is the fork at `/root/projects/DSH-better-sidebar`,
 * branch `sparkelf/kb-save-events`. Reinstalling the dependency therefore means: rebuild
 * and publish from that branch, bump the dependency, and delete this note.
 *
