/**
 * Open a knowledge document in the product's own right-hand file window.
 *
 * The knowledge page does not draw a document preview of its own. Opening a document
 * hands it to the host's sidebar, which is the surface every other file in the
 * workspace opens into: tab strip, path input, preview/edit toggle, save, refresh,
 * outline. The knowledge page owns none of that chrome.
 *
 * Two host services are involved, both published before any panel mounts:
 *
 * - `sidebarRight` (`ui-sidebar-right`) owns the column. Its `openResource` claims the
 *   address, places it, and **reveals the column in the same step** -- the column
 *   expands as part of opening, so a document handed to it cannot land in a collapsed
 *   panel the reader never sees.
 * - `sidebarRightTabs` is the tab-type registry, whose ranking decides which kind
 *   claims a file address. Asking it keeps this open on the host's normal path instead
 *   of hard-coding a kind.
 *
 * The address is built with the official `fileAddressFor`, so a document opened from
 * here dedupes against the tab the chat file-link path already opened for the same
 * file rather than opening a second tab onto it.

  // already uses (markdown, images, plain text -- better-sidebar's editor claims it), so it

  // .pdf/...): better-sidebar refuses those and hands them to the official preview tab,
