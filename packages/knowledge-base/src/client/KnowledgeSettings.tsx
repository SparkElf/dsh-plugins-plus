/**
 * TODO: this page is unreachable from the real entry, and needs a decision.
 *
 * Verified by driving the deployed product on 2026-10-21, not by reading the code:
 * entering 知识库 and clicking 「设置」 in its own rail opens the DSH GLOBAL settings
 * dialog (left nav: 通用设置/模型/内置插件/Agent 预设/DataOps/备份/知识库/插件市场/
 * 侧边卡片), never this component. The rail row sets `selection.kind = 'settings'`,
 * which `KnowledgePanel.tsx` renders as this surface, but the click that a reader can
 * actually reach is the shell's own settings entry, so nothing in the real UI leads
 * here. The review switch below therefore has no user-facing effect today.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT deleted: removing this file, the `rendered.kind === 'settings'`
 * branch in `KnowledgePanel.tsx` and the `menu.settings` rail row is a cross-file
 * structural change, and the choice between "delete the page" and "give it a real
 * entry point" is a product decision rather than a cleanup. Left as-is with this note
 * so the next change starts from the measured fact instead of re-deriving it.
 *
 * What WAS moved: the MinerU service address. It lived here for one round and was
 * invisible to readers for exactly this reason; it now renders in
 * `KnowledgeSettingsSection.tsx` (DSH global settings → 知识库), which is reachable.

/**
 * The settings surface of the management page.
 *
 * This page is now only the review switch: a DECISION about whether other people's
 * contributions take effect immediately, so it is a control and it needs write
 * access. The queue that decision governs and the trail of what it settled both
 * moved to the Audit page, which is the surface an operator opens to get through
 * work; parking a worklist under a configuration switch made them scroll past the
 * setting to reach today's arrivals, and left two duplicate entry points pointing
 * at the same two tables.
 *
 * The switch ships OFF. That is the product decision, not a default that drifted: an
 * operator who never opens this page keeps the behaviour they had, and turning review
 * on is a deliberate act with a visible consequence.
