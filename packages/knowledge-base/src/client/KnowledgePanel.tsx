 * The knowledge-base management page.

 * the rail holds a menu above the knowledge tree, and the content region shows
 * whichever surface the rail selected (a file preview, permissions, or indexing).
 *
 * The tree is this package's own listing rather than the file component from
 * `dsh-better-sidebar`. That component renders icon and name only and builds its
 * context menu internally, so it has nowhere to show whether a row is readable and
 * nowhere to add a grant entry, while the actions its menu does offer (rename,
 * delete, upload) edit a shared curated store rather than deciding who may see a
 * document. The one thing worth keeping from it is the `@`-reference action, reused
 * through its own helper so both trees insert the same reference.
