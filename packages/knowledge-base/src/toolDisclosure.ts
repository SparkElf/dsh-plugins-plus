/**
 * Permission-based disclosure of the model-facing knowledge-base tools.
 *
 * A tool the caller may never use should not be in the model's tool list at all.
 * Registering every tool and refusing inside `execute()` wastes a schema slot,
 * invites a call that will fail, and hides the real capability from the surface
 * that decides what to offer. Disclosure is therefore decided ONCE per permission
 * context: the coordinator registers the tools a context allows and disposes the
 * rest. Execution never re-reads the full permission tree; the backend remains the
 * final authority for every request the tools then make.
 *
 * ## What is decided where
 *
 * - **Disclosure (this module).** A tool's group and its required permission keys
 *   or role capability. Evaluated from the caller's `/api/ai/review/context`
 *   projection (`ManagementContext`), the same object the Settings panel and route
 *   gate already read.
 * - **Data filtering (the tools themselves).** Path-level `canRead` / `canWrite`
 *   calls stay in `execute()`: they decide WHICH rows a visible tool may touch, not
 *   whether the tool exists. The same holds for department-scope filtering of
 *   grants, audit entries and review queues.
 * - **Final authorization (DataOps).** Every backend route the tools call enforces
 *   the JWT's current roles and grants. A stale tool registration can therefore
 *   cause a refusal, never an unauthorized read or write.
 *
 * ## Groups
 *
 * `read` tools exist for a caller with the knowledge-base read key; `write` tools
 * for the editors; `manage` for the administrator/reviewer surfaces; `publish` for
 * workflow publication. Groups exist so a permission change can be applied as a
 * set, and so a fault in one group is reflected in one place rather than in every
 * tool body.
