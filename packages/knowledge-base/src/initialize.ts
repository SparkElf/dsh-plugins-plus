/**
 * First-run initialisation of the authoritative knowledge tree.
 *
 * A deployment that has never been used has no `global/`, `department/` or
 * `personal/` directory, and the reader finds a knowledge base that can hold
 * nothing. The buckets were previously created only as a side effect of some write
 * happening to need their parent, so a fresh share, or one whose buckets were
 * removed, stayed empty with no way to recover.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here:
 *
 * 1. **Every run re-checks the directories.** A bucket someone deleted by hand must
 *    come back on the next start, so "did this already run" is the wrong question
 *    for them; the answer is recomputed from the filesystem each time and costs three
 *    `mkdir` calls.
 * 2. **The tutorial is written once, ever.** It is an ordinary document that the
 *    reader may edit, and an edit is worth more than a newer built-in version, so a
 *    second write is refused and the refusal is the success case.
