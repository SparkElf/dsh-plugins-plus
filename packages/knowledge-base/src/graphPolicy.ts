/**
 * Visibility and management policy for memory graphs.
 *
 * This module is the pure decision layer only: callers resolve the viewer's
 * department subtree (`visibleDepartmentCodes`) and manageable subtree from
 * DataOps, then ask one graph at a time. It never reads configuration, never
 * touches the file system, and never invents a broader scope than it was handed.
 *
 * The rules come from the memory-graph design:
 *
 * - `private` belongs to its owner; administrators and super administrators do
 *   not see it by default (breaking the glass is a separate, audited action);
 * - `global` is readable by any authenticated viewer;
 * - `department` requires the graph's department code in the viewer's visible
 *   subtree. Department administrators understand their subtree through
 *   `manageableDepartmentCodes`; a plain member has neither the role nor the
 *   list.
 *
 * @module @sparkelf/dsh-knowledge-base/graph-policy
