/**
 * Projection adapter: new `.graphs/<id>/graph.json` graphs into the graph tab's
 * existing DOMAIN tree (`scope -> graph -> topic -> documents`).
 *
 * The graph tab was built for the legacy layout, where every node was a visible
 * topic folder. The new model keeps node bodies wherever the classification tree
 * wants them and only records topology in `graph.json`, so it has no topic folder
 * to point at. Projecting each node into a topic card keeps the existing canvas,
 * tree and breadcrumb working unchanged while the authoritative topology stays in
 * `graph.json`; the projection is derived, never written back.
 *
 * The legacy scanner stays authoritative for legacy graphs. This module is pure:
 * it receives already-loaded graphs and returns browser-safe nodes, so it never
 * touches the filesystem and cannot widen what the Host resolved.
 *
