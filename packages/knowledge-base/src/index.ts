/**
 * Knowledge-base Host plugin.
 *
 * This package owns three things and nothing else:
 * 1. The protocol contract toward the DataOps knowledge API (`protocol.ts`).
 * 2. Idempotent deployment recipes for the remote pieces, run over the
 *    ssh-manager seam (`deploy.ts`, `remote.ts`).
 * 3. The same-origin HTTP surface the Settings panel reads, plus the
 *    model-facing `kb_search` / `kb_chunk_get` / `kb_outline` / `kb_file_*` tools.
 *
 * It owns no authorization logic. DataOps AuthGuard and PermissionGuard resolve
 * the caller's roles and grants from the session credential; this plugin only
 * forwards requests (AGENTS.md "Managed DataOps Authorization").
 *
 * Content retrieval is deliberately absent. Once the view tree is mounted the
 * official `grep`, `read`, `write`, and `edit` tools operate on it as an
 * ordinary local path, so this capability does not duplicate them.
 *
 * @module @sparkelf/dsh-knowledge-base

 *   a reader will find the document in their view at their next sync. That is what
 *   a knowledge base is for, and it is the semantic the product already has.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `userId` component in the path. `actual/` is shared and
 * has no per-user dimension; inventing `actual/<uid>/...` would create a shape the
 * rest of the plugin does not understand, because a view is built from grants and
