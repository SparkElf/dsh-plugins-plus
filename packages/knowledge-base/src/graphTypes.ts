/**
 * The read-only knowledge-graph shape shared by the Host scanner and the browser.
 *
 * A graph is an ordinary knowledge folder: `<scope>/知识图谱/<graph>/` with one
 * visible sub-folder per topic and the relation documents under `.kg/links/`. The
 * graph tab therefore speaks a DOMAIN model (scope → graph → topic) rather than the
 * file tree's path model. Keeping the shape in one dependency-free module is what
 * lets the Host build it and the canvas page render it without a second translation
 * layer that could disagree about a field name.
 *
 * Paths here are VIEW-relative (`global/知识图谱/…`, `department/…`,
 * `personal/知识图谱/…`): the personal owner segment is deliberately absent, exactly
 * as the file tree shows it. The Host resolves the authoritative path first; the
 * browser never needs to know the caller's uid.
 *
