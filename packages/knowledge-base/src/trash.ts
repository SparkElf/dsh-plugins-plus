/**
 * Tombstones: paths a caller has removed from their view without destroying the file.
 *
 * ## Why a tombstone rather than an unlink
 *
 * A view is hardlinks into one authoritative tree, and several callers' views may
 * hold a link to the same inode. Unlinking the caller's own link would hide the file
 * from them, but it would also make the removal indistinguishable from a revoked
 * grant: the next `syncView` compares grants to links, finds a grant with no link,
 * and puts the link back. Nothing in the filesystem can say "this one was removed on
 * purpose".
 *
 * So removal is recorded rather than performed. A tombstone is a note that says a
 * path is hidden from one caller's view, checked while the view is being built. The
 * file keeps its inode, every other caller keeps their link, and restoring is
 * deleting the note.
 *
 * ## What a tombstone is scoped to
 *
 * A tombstone belongs to a CALLER, not to a path: two people sharing a document may
 * disagree about whether it should be in their view. It therefore lives in the
 * caller's own directory and filters only that caller's view.
 *
 * A tombstone is not a permission. It hides what the caller may still be granted;
 * it never grants anything, and a restore cannot resurrect access that DataOps has
 * since withdrawn -- the grant is checked first, and a path whose grant is gone
 * stays gone whatever the tombstone says.
