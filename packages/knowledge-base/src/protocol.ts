/**
 * The knowledge-base protocol contract.
 *
 * This module is the Client's authoritative declaration of what the
 * knowledge-base capability needs from its backend. A DataOps deployment
 * implements these endpoints; this package never talks to the NAS directly and
 * never decides authorization itself.
 *
 * Design boundary (see the design textbook, chapter 9):
 * - Transport is HTTPS with the DataOps session credential.
 * - Retrieval is NOT part of this protocol. Content search runs over the
 *   mounted copy with the official `grep` and `read` tools, because the mount
 *   makes the remote tree a local path. Only configuration, authorization
 *   changes, and index generation cross this boundary.
 * - File transfer is NOT part of this protocol. Files are read and written
 *   through the mount point.
