/**

 * Two directions, deliberately different in shape:
 *
 * - **Uplink** is `fetch` with an awaited acknowledgement. The backend assigns the
 *   globally ordered `id` and returns the finalized event, so the caller can append
 *   that exact event locally. A message that the backend rejects never reaches the
 *   append-only session log.
 * - **Downlink** is a pull by cursor. The backend is the only cross-container
 *   intersection point, so it is also the only authority on order; a cursor is the
 *   whole synchronization state.
 *
 * This module owns no policy: it does not decide who may post where, whether a
 * mention should wake an agent, or which events enter the model. It moves events.
