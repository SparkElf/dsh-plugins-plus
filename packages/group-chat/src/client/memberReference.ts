/**
 * Room members as `@` mentions in the composer.
 *
 * The `@` menu is a multi-source pipeline: every source owns one group, and a pick becomes an
 * official inline chip. A member is picked the same way a room message is, but the chip declares
 * itself with `appearance: 'mention'`, which is what makes the composer hand the picked ids to the
 * Host as `prompt.mentions` instead of leaving them to be re-parsed out of the prompt text. The
 * Host's routing reads ids by design ("never parsed out of message text"): text parsing would
 * misread a code sample containing `@` and would let any message smuggle itself into an execution
 * path.
 *
 * The group appears only in a room: `candidates` answers an empty list everywhere else, and an
 * empty group closes itself, so a normal session's `@` menu is unchanged.
 *
 * @module @sparkelf/dsh-group-chat/client/memberReference
