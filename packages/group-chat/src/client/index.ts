/**
 * Group-chat Client plugin.
 *
 * Registers two official DSH surfaces:
 * - `sidebar.footer.action` renders the group-chat region at the sidebar foot, under the
 *   workspace list and above Settings. The shell positions it inside `footerActions`
 *   (full width, `flex: none`); this plugin draws the section header and the flat room
 *   list. It is an ordinary list seat, so no other plugin's contribution is disturbed.
 * - The matching `main` key gives the room page the region's rows select, so a room opens
 *   in the main column rather than replacing the navigation column.
 *
 * This half owns the room list so the two surfaces cannot disagree about which rooms
 * exist. Both read the one store below and both re-read through the same action.
 *
 * The page is a pure consumer of the Host plugin's `/dsh-group-chat/api` route, so every
 * room operation it performs is the same call the agent's own turn makes. The browser
 * never talks to DataOps directly and never handles a credential: the Host holds the
 * workspace identity, and this half only renders what that identity can already see.
 *
