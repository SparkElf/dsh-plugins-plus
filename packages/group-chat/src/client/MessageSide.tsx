/**
 * Left/right placement for group-chat messages.
 *
 * The official Chat renderer draws every user message right-aligned — its own CSS is
 * unconditional (`align-items: flex-end`), with no self/other distinction, because in an
 * ordinary Session the only author is the operator. A room has several authors, so the
 * side has to carry a meaning the official renderer does not compute: this workspace's own
 * messages stay right, everyone else's move left.
 *
 * It is implemented by **wrapping the official renderer, not replacing it**. The official
 * component is read back out of the slot registry and rendered as an element, so markdown,
 * images, file and skill references, per-message actions and the streaming behaviour all
 * stay the official implementation's. Re-drawing the bubble here would have to track every
 * one of those forever.
 *
 * An ordinary Session is untouched: a message with no room source is rendered through the
 * official component with no wrapper at all, which is what keeps the two paths equal in
 * what they draw.
 *
 * Another author's message also carries their name and picture above the bubble. The official
 * renderer draws neither — in an ordinary Session every message is the operator's own, so there
 * is no author to attribute — and the event itself carries only the author's id. The name and
 * picture therefore come from the roster, looked up by that id. When the roster has not loaded,
 * or the author has since left, the message renders bare rather than labelled with an id: a
 * wrong name is worse than no name.
