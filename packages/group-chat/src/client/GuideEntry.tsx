/**
 * The members page's box on the right sidebar's start guide, drawn only while a room is open.
 *
 * The start guide lists every registered page type so a reader can open one. Its list is
 * global — the registry builds it from every registration and offers no per-Session filter — so
 * a type that appears there is offered in every conversation, including ordinary ones that have
 * no room behind them. Picking it there would open a panel that can only say "not a group chat",
 * which is a dead end for the reader and noise in the guide.
 *
 * The guide renders each box through its own entry seat, keyed by the contributing type's id, so
 * a type may replace its own box. This draws the box while a room is open and nothing otherwise.
 * The cell wrapping it is a fixed-width, auto-height container with no border or background, so
 * an empty box leaves no gap.
 *
 * Rendering `null` rather than unregistering the type is deliberate: the guide is consulted once
 * per registration change, not per navigation, so a registration toggled by the current Session
 * would either be stale by the time the guide renders or churn on every room switch. The type
 * also has to stay registered for a placed tab to survive a reload.
 *
