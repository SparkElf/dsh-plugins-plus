/**
 * How this plugin learns where its server is and who it is.
 *
 * The **protocol**, not DataOps, is the contract: any server implementing the
 * documented room endpoints works, so nothing here is specific to DataOps. A
 * deployment supplies values through the plugin's own settings, and DataOps
 * additionally injects environment defaults into its workspace containers so the
 * first-run experience needs no typing.
 *
 * Resolution order is settings first, environment second:
 *
 * 1. An explicit setting always wins — that is what an operator edits, and it is
 *    how a workspace points at any conforming server.
 * 2. The DataOps environment variables fill whatever the settings leave blank.

 * the workspace files, and any relative path they type all resolve exactly as they do in an
 * ordinary session. Pointing the cwd at the shared tree instead made `kb/x.md` resolve under
 * it and fail with ENOENT — a shared folder must add a place to look, not move the place
 * every other path is measured from.
 *
 * The shared tree is reached through {@link ROOM_SHARED_LINK}, a symlink the container keeps
 * at the workspace root. A symlink rather than a hardlink is the only option that works
 * across the two mounts: a directory cannot be hardlinked at all, and a file hardlink across
 * mount points fails with EXDEV. It also keeps the two views independent, which is what a
 * shared folder needs — adding or removing a file must not touch the other name.
 *
 * `room.cwd` still wins: a creator who named a directory meant it, and a room whose members
 * deliberately share one scope is a supported configuration.
 *
 * @param roomId - the room the directory belongs to.
 * @param configured - the room's own `cwd`, when its creator set one.
 * @param env - environment bag; defaults to `process.env`.
 * @returns an absolute directory path, which the caller must create before use.
