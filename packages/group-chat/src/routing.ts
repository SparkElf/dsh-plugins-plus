/**
 * The routing rule that decides whether an incoming room event wakes this
 * workspace's agent.
 *
 * The rule is a single sentence: **only a member's own mention of themselves runs
 * that member's agent**. Everything else is recorded and read, never executed.
 *
 * The consequences are worth stating because they are the point of the design:
 *
 * - Nobody can drive someone else's agent, so nobody can spend another member's
 *   model budget or reach their files through a mention.
 * - `@everyone` and `@someone-else` are ordinary messages. They broadcast; they do
 *   not fan out into N agent runs.
 * - Every message still reaches every agent's context, so an agent answering later
 *   has read the whole conversation. Execution is gated; visibility is not.
